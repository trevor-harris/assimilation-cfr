Depth can be used to identify unusual or outlying functions within a set a functions. Often functions exhibit two major sources of variation: phase and amplitude. Depth can be applied directly to the observed functions or to the phase and amplitude separately. Some characteristics may be present in the phase or the amplitude alone or in some combination of the two. How can depth information from the components be integrated to identify unusual characteristics in the observed functions. This could further lead to identify clusters or performing classification in the observed functions based on information in the components, possibly using depth.

## The Setup

1. Assume we have a **finite collection of 1 dimensional random functons g** from some space F on a compact domain [0, 1]. 
2. g(t) = a(p(t))
   1. The oberved functions have the following structure. g is composed of a **phase** (p) and **amplitude** (a) function
   2. assume that **a**() and **p**() are separable given observations of g().

## The plan

- Phase 1: Identify how to integrate depth information from the phase and amplitude to get depth information on the original functions.
- Phase 2: Do something with classification and then clustering (regression and PCA?)
