- 1/24 - Got data preprocessing code from Bo. Tested out approximate SVD from the irlba package. Seems to return the same (top) eigenvalues/functions as regular SVD. Still requires a covariance matrix which I would ideally like to circumvent or make sparse.
- 1/27 - Testing out the differences between basis functions generated by subsampling spatial points. Eigenvalues remain similar (off by a factor of the subscaling). Eigenfunctions returned by subsampling seem to be (essentially) rescaled versions of denser ones, so they should be usable without any issue. Do I subsample the data when projecting it though? Or extend out the basis vectors?
- 1/28 - Worked out a lot of the details of the preprocessing. Still need to confirm that the smoothing is adequate and the steps ive taken are correct. Also I need to figure out what the cos section is for exactly.
