## Last Week

1. Found the Normal approximation to the Wilcoxon test
2. Redid MSE and BIC plots and found the new optimal basis
3. Created the horizontal comparisons
4. Started compiling results into a latex document 
5. Read the following Riemannian papers but my understanding is still a bit shaky
   1. CSDA_fdaTB_final 
   2. CSDA_PCA_12 
   3. Rosenthal

## This Week

1. Try to figure out if the Wilcoxon sign rank test is the way to go or not. 
   1. Meet with Naveen?
   2. Alternatively use or adapt a Kolmogorov-Smirnov like test
2. Analyze and create plots and for vertical comparisons
   1. Number of prior spatial fields outside the posterior X% central region? Or vice versa
   2. Extremal depths over time
   3. What makes this section different from horizontal comparisons? Interpretation?
3. Re-read Riemannian papers
   1. CSDA_fdaTB_final —> CSDA_PCA_12 —> Rosenthal
   2. Start reading the others
