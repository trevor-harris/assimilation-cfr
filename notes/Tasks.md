# Tasks

- Implement basis function system
  1. ~~Scrap the Eigendecomp method~~
  2. ~~Create radial (bisquare) basis functions~~
     1. Check that these are accurate and everything lines up (semi done)
- Implement a (modified) version of Extremal data depth for handling noisy functional data
  1. ~~Implement standard ED~~
     1. Test these against easy functions (semi done)
  2. ~~Implement central regions~~
     1. Test these against easy functions (semi done)
  3. Modify ED to handle points being slightly outside 
     1. Ask Naveen for papers related to this
     2. Setup meeting with Naveen and Bo 
     3. Think about what sort of tolerances should be allowed
- Compare ensemble with prior
  - What should results here look like? Graphs? a summary statistic? Check the Smerdon paper
- Compare ensemble with target ensemble
  - Need to get data for this
  - Implement or find FDR methods for these sort of tests
  - Same as above
